        <P>The McLaren P1 is a sports car produced by British marque McLaren Automotive. It is a plug-in hybrid with a mid-engine layout. It was first shown at the 2012 Paris Motor Show,[5] with sales of the P1 beginning in the United Kingdom in October 2013 and all of the limited run of 375 units sold by November 2013.[6][7] Production ended in early December 2015.[8] The United States accounted for 34% of the units and Europe for 26%.[8]

            It is considered by the automotive press to be the successor to the McLaren F1, utilising hybrid power and Formula One technology, but does not have the same three-seat layout. McLaren later stated that the Speedtail serves as the actual successor to the McLaren F1.
            
            The P1 has a mid-engine, rear wheel drive design that used a carbon fibre monocoque and roof structure safety cage concept called MonoCage, which is a development of the MonoCell first used in the MP4-12C and then in subsequent models. Its main competitors are the LaFerrari and the 918 Spyder. They are all similar in specifications and performance, and in a race around Silverstone circuit they were all within half a second of each other, the P1 finishing first at 58.24 seconds and the LaFerrari finishing last at 58.58 seconds; the 918 was in-between with 58.46 seconds.[9]
            
            Parts of the car were inspired by a sailfish that Frank Stephenson saw when on holiday in Miami.[10]
            
            58 units of the track-oriented P1 GTR[11] and 5 units of its road legal counterpart, the P1 LM were produced after the initial run of 375 cars.
            
            13 experimental prototypes 'XP', 5 validation prototypes 'VP',[12] and 3 pre-production 'PP' cars were produced by McLaren before the production of the P1 started.[13] A number of these 21 test cars have been refurbished, modified and sold to customers.[14]</P>
        <h1>production and sales</h1>
        <p>The production version of the McLaren P1 was unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show.[27] Production was strictly limited to 375 units which, according to McLaren, is to maintain exclusivity.

            In August 2013 McLaren announced that the production allocation destined to the Americas, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East was sold out.[28] The cars destined for Europe were sold out by mid November 2013.[7] The United States accounted for 34% of the limited production run, and Europe for 26%.[8]
            
            After some delays, production began in October 2013.[29] Hand-assembled by a team of 61 engineers, at a production rate of one car per day McLaren production was planned for fifty cars by the end of 2013.[30] The first delivery to a retail customer took place at the company's headquarters in Woking, England, in October 2013,[6] with 12 units manufactured by mid November 2013.[7] The first P1 delivery in the U.S. occurred in May 2014.[31] The production run ended in December 2015.[8]
            
            According to JATO Dynamics, only twenty units had been registered worldwide during the first nine months of 2014.[32] A total of 12 P1s were registered in Switzerland during 2014,[33] and an additional five units between January and August 2015.[34] About 59 units were delivered in the U.S. in 2014,[35] and sales in the American market totalled about 127 units delivered through December 2015.[8]</p>
