            The nature of Georgia offers an incredible variety of landscapes, flora and fauna. 
            Georgia is situated on the Black Sea coast between the mountain ranges of the Greater Caucasus in the north and the Lesser Caucasus in the south. 
            Mountains occupy two thirds of Georgiaâ€™s land area. 
            In the west of the country lies the Colchis lowland. 
            Eastern Georgia has fertile plains in the historical areas of Imeretia, Kartli and Kakhetia.
    
            Nearly one third of the area of the country is occupied with forest concentrated mainly in the mountains. 
            The eastern foothills have extensive coniferous and boreal forest. 
            In the west of Georgia, wooded areas hug the Black Sea coast. 
            The woods of the Black Sea coast are especially rich and varied. 
            There you can see alpine and subalpine meadows, a magnificent variety of herbs, and even subtropical rainforest. 
            Relic pines are frequently found there too.
            
            Endemic flora of Georgian nature includes approximately 2,600 species of fungi. 
            Most notably, the nature of Georgia is bountiful where fruits and vegetables are concerned. 
            Grapes have been grown in Georgia for untold millennia and archaeological 
            evidence suggests that wine may have first been manufactured here over 8000 years ago.
